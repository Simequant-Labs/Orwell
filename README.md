# Orwell — On-Chain Data & Intelligence

Orwell is an on-chain data platform for intelligence and analysis.

The system observes blockchain activity, ingests and persists events,
and exposes the resulting data through queryable APIs and streaming
interfaces.

This enables historical analysis, monitoring, replay, and automated
decision-making for protocols, funds, and builders.

This repository serves as a public reference point for the Orwell project.
